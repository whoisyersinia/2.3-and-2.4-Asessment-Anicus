# 2.3-and-2.4-Assessment - Anicus

## **About**
#### Welcome to Anicus. My NCEA Level 2 Digital Technolgies Assessment. <br>
Anicus which comes from Anime Ani- and Marcus -cus hence Anicus. Anicus is a platform for users (my friends) to track their favourite Anime series 
and share their favorites 
by creating a list that 
they can share with their friends. Anicus is made with PHP, HTML, CSS using 
Bootstrap 5, and 
JavaScript (+ jQuery) with SQL as my database.

### **My Purpose**
My purpose for Anicus is to be a platform for my friends and I to track their favourite anime series and put it on their  personal list and for us to see each others list, to make comments and reviews.
